			Bio:
			</h2>
			
			The Piano Man, also known by his full name, Robert B. Newmaker, is a tall, lanky, otter adjacent sapine known for his proficiency in the musical fine arts of being a pianist and composer. His early life was an enigma as he never seemed to enjoy talking about his upbringing. For this reason, we will skip over the early life section of his biography.<br> Something to note though is he says that his love of music and journey of playing the piano began at a very young age, he agrees that it's safe to say he began at around the age of 5. Throughout his entire life he continued to practice and play as an outlet for his boredom and other emotions. <br>When he graduated from high school, he went straight into a 4 year college in order to pursue a career with his love for the piano. During this journey, he also met his now wife, Carrie Leskowits. After graduating from college he began to work both to of course feed himself and Carrie, but also to raise funds for a laboratory she wanted to make. <br>Around a year or so after the laboratory was founded with the fulfilled funds, when Robert was around 27, Carrie and Robert both had a <a href="newmaker.html">child.</a> Robert continued to practice the piano, this time now passing down the hobby to his son. Unfortunately, 9 years later, his son passed away from lung cancer. <br>While his wife furthered all efforts of the lab to attempt to bring her son back, he continued to practice and work harder to improve and make as much money as he could to assist with the efforts of his wife. To further push his body, he also injected an experimental serum from the lab that was said to decrease the amount of sleep and food neccesary for his body to fully function. It is because of this that his body looks like what it does now, as it has been said he'd practice days on end without sleep or nutrition. As of the current date of writing this, he has been seen very rarely around the lab. Some people have proposed the idea of him being in a secret unknown location, continuing to practice his piano.
