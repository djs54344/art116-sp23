			Bio:
			</h2>
			
			The Feline of Ink is a large house cat adjcacent creature composed entirely of pen ink. Not much is known about the feline other than it being very old, despite having thought to have origins in CL. They are known to have spearheaded the specimen's riot upon the laboratory's staff, although the occupation of the lab by the specimens is up for debate. His current whereabouts are also up for debate, although it is thought that wherever he is, the other specimen are as well.
