			Bio:
			</h2>
			
			<span>secret</span> Newmaker, a young otter adjacent sapine, lived together with his mother, Carrie Newmaker, and his father, <a href="tpm.html">Robert Newmaker.</a> He loved practicing piano with his father and consuming horror media with his mother. His Mother is the founder of a biological laboratory focusing on genetics and gene splicing, known as Chimera Labs. His father a very well known pianist. <br>Unbeknownst to his parents, he started to develop lung cancer at the age of 6. By the time he was 8 years old his parents got him diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. He, unfortunately, passed away in his mother's arms 3 months after he turned 9 years old. <br>Wrought with grief, his mother felt that her son died too soon, and she did not want to let his life go. When <span>nope</span> took his <a href="world.html">last breath</a>, his mother scooped it up in an airtight jar. She began to dedicate all efforts of the lab into finding a way to bring her son back by any means neccesary. When she finally found a way to bring him back, the lab had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding. The mismanagement eventually caused the laboratory's housed specimens to start a riot against the staff. The riot left the current state of the lab to be questioned, as it is currently unknown whether or not there are any remaining living entities. With his last breath stored, the way Mrs. Newmaker brought her son back was by managing to write his soul into an analog frequency, allowing him to explore the world wherever the signal strength from his transmitter allows him to.
