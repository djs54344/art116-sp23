			Story:
			</h2>
			
			<mark>secret</mark> Newmaker lived together with his mother, Carrie Newmaker, and his father, Paul Newmaker. He loved practicing piano with his father and consuming horror media with his mother. His Mother is the founder of a biological laboratory focusing on genetics and gene splicing, known as Chimera Labs. His father a very well known pianist. <br>Unbeknownst to his parents, he started to develop lung cancer at the age of 6. By the time he was 8 years old his parents got him diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. He, unfortunately, passed away in his mother's arms 3 months after he turned 9 years old. <br>Wrought with grief, his mother felt the need to find a way to bring him back to life, in any way possible. When <mark>nope</mark> took his last breath, his mother scooped it up in an airtight jar. She began to dedicate all efforts of the lab into finding a way to bring his son back. When she finally found a way to bring him back, the lab had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding. This mismanagement eventually caused the laboratory's housed specimens to start a riot against the staff, causing its current state to be left up for debate. In the end, the way that she brought him back was managing to write his soul into an analog frequency, allowing him to explore the world wherever the signal strength from his transmitter allows him to.
