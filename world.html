			Sapines
			</h2>
			
			<i>Pilosum sapien</i>, also known as Sapines, are a species very similar to humans although often appearring with more animalistic features, such as long cat-like ears, long fur, short snouts, whiskers, and more. Each of these traits are genetically passed down to one another, causing their own adaptation to be quick. They originate from anywhere in Central and South America. Males have an average height of 5'3" (160cm) and females have an average height of 4'10" (147.32cm). Males have an average weight of 120 lbs (54.43kg), and females have an average weight of 100lbs (45.36 kg).

			"Last Breath"
			</h2>
			An organism's soul is comprised entirely of an unknown gas, and contained on the inside of their brain. Every organism's soul contains their memories, thoughts, and knowledge of the appearance of their physical body. Whenever an organism dies, they release one final breath, and with it they release their soul.

			Chimera Labs
			</h2>
			
			The laboratory founded by Carrie Newmaker. This laboratory was focused on the experimentation of genetic splicing, hybrid making, and other forms of organic "fusion." (the term fusion will be used to describe any form of combination of different entities to create a new living organism) Chimera Labs housed many many specimens which were results of their experiments. The laboratory also doubled as a sanctuary for these experiments, as many of them were disabilitated or unable to function as they previously did. They are credited to be among the first groups to find out how to fuse inanimate objects genetically with living organisms, along with fusing organisms from different kingdoms. The laboratory is now considered abandoned since the specimens' riot following the concentration of the laboratory's efforts onto bringing <span>nada</span> Newmaker back from the dead.
